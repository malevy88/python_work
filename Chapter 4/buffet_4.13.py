# a buffet style restuarant offers only five basic foods. think of five basic foods and store them in a tuple.
# use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers. try to modify one of the items and make sure that Python rejects the change
# the restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different foods. add a line that rewrites the tuple, then use a for loop
# to print each of the item on the revised menu
