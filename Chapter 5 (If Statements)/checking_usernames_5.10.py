# make a list of five or more usernames called current_users
# make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of
# new usernames are also in the current_users list.
# loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been
# used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new
# username. If a username has not bee used, print a messhae saying the username
# is available. Make sure the your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John'
# has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted. (To do this, you'll need to make
# a copy of current_users containing the lowercase versions of all exisiting
# users.)
