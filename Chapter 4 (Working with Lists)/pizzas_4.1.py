# think of at least 3 kinds of your favorite pizza.
# store these pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name 
# of each.
# modify you for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza, instead 
# of printing just the name of the pizza.
# for each, you should have one line of output containing a simple statement 
# like "I like pepperoni pizza".
# make a line at the end of your program, outside the loop, that states how much 
# you like pizza. The output should consist of three or more line about the 
# kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as I really love 
# pizza!
